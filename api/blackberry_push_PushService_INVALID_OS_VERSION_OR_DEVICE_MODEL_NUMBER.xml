    <shortdesc><i>Result error code for when a device attempting to do a create channel has an invalid operating system version number or an invalid device model number. Operations this error can occur on: createChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: Retrying the operation is not recommended since this is an unrecoverable error that is out of control of the application. It might make sense to communicate this issue up to the user.</i></shortdesc>
