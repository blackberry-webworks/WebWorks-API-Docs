    		<p>A recurrence exception is a differing instance of a recurring event. The originalStartTime property stores the time and date of the recurrence instance that is replaced by this event.  For example: a daily meeting at 2:00 PM that is rescheduled to  3:00 PM on a given day would have an originalStartTime of 2:00 PM.</p>
