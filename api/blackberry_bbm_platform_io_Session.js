 * @class A connection to communicate with one or more peers, where <b>the peers are aware of each other</b>.
 * <p>Peers may in turn invite other users, who are also visible to everyone in the session, whether or not they are contacts of the session originator.</p>
 * <p>For example, a session connection could be used for a multi-player game application such as a poker game. When all the users in the session want to see the poker table, and game data is sent to each player in the game as it occurs.</p>
 * <b>User A invites user B, and user B joins the session</b>

 * <b>User C invites user D, and user D joins the session</b>

 * Once a user has joined they can send data to anyone in the session.
