	 * <p/>Note: The BlackBerry PlayBook's "Application Behavior" setting has an impact on when onBackground gets dispatched. When "Application Behavior" is set to "Default", onBackground does not get dispatched until another application goes fullscreen.  When "Application Behavior" is set to "Showcase", onBackground does not get dispatched because all open applications stay active. When "Application Behavior" is set to "Paused", onBackground gets dispatched once the application is sent to the background.
