 * @BB50+

 * @BB10X 
 * @RIPPLE
 * @namespace The Push object allows you to leverage the BlackBerry push architecture to receive push data in your application.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Since the state for JavaScript for a web page is only as long as the web page is being viewed, there is a need for 
 * the app to maintain the open listener for push information. This allows this listening for push data to remain open 
 * between page transitions. If no current active callback is assigned to the push listener, the app will queue the 
 * push data (limiting the number of messages using maxQueueCap if available) for the application until a subsequent 
 * openPushListener call is made. 
 * At that point it will then pass the data to the subscribed callback function. To subscribe to the same previously 
 * opened push listener on a new web page, a secondary call to openPushListener is called. In this scenario it will 
 * reassign the callback provided to the already open listener. 
 * <br/><br/>
 * <p/>
 * It is possible for the BlackBerry Push Service to automatically unregister a subscriber behind the scenes. 
 * When writing a push application, to combat this possible automatic unregister, you should offer one of the following options: 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Explicit register, unregister menu options.</li>
 * <li>Use automatic, periodic registration calls to the BlackBerry Push Service to ensure that subscribers receive their desired pushes.  
 * The period you pick would depend on the application you write.  If you plan to send out a high frequency of pushes to a subscriber in a given day, you will want to make the registration calls more frequent (e.g. once a day).  If your application will only send out a low number of pushes in a given day to a subscriber, then you can make the registration calls less frequent (e.g. once a week or once a month).</li>
 * </ol>

	/**
	* Registers a callback function that will be called when new data has been pushed to the device. <br/><br/>
	* If calling openPushListener on a page where the port is already open, the callback will be updated to use the 
	* latest one passed in. <b>NOTE:</b> In such cases where consecutive calls to openPushListener occurs on the page,
	* the transport argument will only be used on the first call, and ignored for all others. Any calls to 
	* openPushListener should have matching calls to closePushListener to ensure ports are not left open accidentally.
	* <br/><br/>Known issue: Running multiple push applications or opening multiple port in the same application could cause large CPU usage. It is recommended to use new push API when writing new push application. Opening multiple ports in the same application is not allowed in the new push API.
	* @deprecated This API is deprecated, please use {@link blackberry.push.openBESPushListener} or {@link blackberry.push.openBISPushListener} instead.
	* <br/><br/><b>Known Issues:</b><br/>Using this API in multiple applications could cause large CPU usage on some of the applications. It is recommened to use ({@link blackberry.push.openBESPushListener} or {@link blackberry.push.openBISPushListener}) instead.
	* @callback {function} onData This callback function is triggered when data is received.To enable reliable push and acknowledge receipt of the payload, the callback must explicitly return 0 indicating that the push message has been accepted.Returning any other value (including not returning anything at all) in the callback would indicate that the message has been declined.
	* @callback {blackberry.push.Data} onData.data Object that contains the data that was just received. It has a payload property which is a Blob. The developer can then retrieve the data either as a Blob or use blackberry.utils.blobToString() function to convert it into a string if the data is a string.
	* @param {Number} port Integer port number to listen on for push data.
	* @param {blackberry.identity.Transport} [transport] Optional parameter where you can choose which communications transport you wish to listen on.
	* @param {Number} [maxQueueCap] Optional parameter that specifies how many messages the app should queue if the port was not closed, but a function handler was lost (for example, during a page transition).
