/**
 * @toc {BBM} Other Users
 * @featureID blackberry.bbm.platform
 * @namespace Provides access to and interaction with other users. For the current user see
 * {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.self}.
 * 
 * <h3>Picking Users</h3>
 * <p>The application can display a Contact Picker to the user with {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.pickUsers}.
 * This is generally part of a larger use case. For example, <code>pickUsers()</code> might be used
 * so that the current user can select players to remove from a connection.
 * 
 * <p><b>The Contact Picker will be displayed for all methods in this namespace.</b> The Contact Picker can be
 * avoided in {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.sendFile} and {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.startBBMChat}
 * by providing a {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.BBMPlatformUser} in the method call.
 * 
 * <h3>File Transfer, Invite to Download, Starting a BBM Chat, and Sharing Content</h3>
 * <p>The current user can send files, start a chat in BBM, invite others to download the
 * application, and share content using the following methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.sendFile}
 * <li>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.startBBMChat}
 * <li>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.inviteToDownload}
 * <li>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.shareContent}
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Inviting users to BBM contact list</h3>
 * <p>Inviting users to the current user's contact list is also supported. You can invite anonymous
 * users by PIN using {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.inviteToBBM}. Alternatively you can invite
 * users from open connection(s) using {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.inviteToBBMFromConnections}.
 * 
 * <h3>BBM Social Graph</h3>
 * <p>Applications can also obtain access to the user's social graph.
 * {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.contactsWithApp} is a complete list of the current user's BBM
 * contacts who have the application installed.
 * 
 * <p>Applications can also listen for changes in the social graph by assigning a callback to
 * {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.users.event:onupdate}. Events are fired for both the current user
 * and their contacts who have the application installed. You can listen for user profile property
 * changes, such as display name and display picture, and also when a user installs/uninstalls your
 * application.
