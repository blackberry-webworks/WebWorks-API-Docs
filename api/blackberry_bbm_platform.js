 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Accessing other namespaces under</b> {@link blackberry.bbm.platform} <b>may throw exceptions

     * @description Registers for access to BBM Platform.
     * <p>The application must assign a callback to {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.event:onaccesschanged}
     * before registering. During registration, a dialog will be shown to guide the user through the registration process.
     * The application should wait until {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.event:onaccesschanged} is invoked before continuing.</p>
     * <h4>Application in Test Environment</h4>
     * Applications must provide a UUID used to identify the application in the test
     * environment. If the application is in App World then the UUID will not be used. The same
     * UUID should be used for future releases of the same application; otherwise communication
     * between them will not be possible. The UUID must be a randomly generated 36-character UUID.
     * Any UUID generator can be used.
     * @param {Object} options Options.
     * @param {String} options.uuid ID used to identify the application in the test environment.
     * @throws {IllegalStateException} If <code>blackberry.bbm.platform.onaccesschanged</code> is not assigned.
     * @throws {IllegalArgumentException} If <code>UUID</code> is not a valid 36-character UUID.
     * @example
     * &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     * 
     * // Create callback invoked when access changes
     * blackberry.bbm.platform.onaccesschanged = function(accessible, status) {
