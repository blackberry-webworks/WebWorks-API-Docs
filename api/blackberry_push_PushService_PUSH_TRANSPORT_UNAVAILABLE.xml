    <shortdesc><i>Result error code when a create channel or destroy channel operation has failed due to network issues or the push transport being down. Operations this error can occur on: createChannel, destroyChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: Wait until pushTransportReadyCallback (one of the arguments in the static create function) is called before retrying. This error can also occur when the user's wireless connection (e.g. Wi-Fi, Mobile Network) is off or temporarily down, so it might make sense to communicate this issue up to the user to double check their wireless connection.</i></shortdesc>
