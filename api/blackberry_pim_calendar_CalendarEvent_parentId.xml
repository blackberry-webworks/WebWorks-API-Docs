        	<p>A recurrence exception is a differing instance of a recurring event. An example: a daily meeting at 2:00 PM that is rescheduled to 3:00 PM on a given day. This rescheduled occurrence is represented as an exception. It is stored in the database as a separate event and it references the original recurring event by means of the parent id.</p>
