/**
 * @toc {BBM} Connections
 * @featureID blackberry.bbm.platform
 * @namespace Provides services to create, accept, and manage connections.
 * <h3>Connections</h3>
 * <h4>Connection types</h4>
 * The BBM Platform supports the following types of connections:
 * <br/>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Channel}
 * <br/>{@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Session}
 * 
 * <h4>Creating a connections</h4>
 * <p>Connections can be created using {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.createConnection}.
 * When a connection is created, the application should assign callbacks to it in order to be notified
 * of various events.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * var type = ... // One of "channel" or "session"
 * var conn = blackberry.bbm.platform.io.createConnection(type);
 * setConnectionCallbacks(conn, type);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Accepting incoming connections</h4>
 * When the current user accepts an invitation within BBM, {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.event:onconnectionaccepted}
 * will be invoked with the connection on which the invitation was accepted. The application should
 * assign callbacks to the connection within this method.
 * <pre>
 * var conn;
 * 
 * blackberry.bbm.platform.io.onconnectionaccepted = function(type, connection, cookie) {
 *     // Save the connection and set the callbacks
 *     conn = connection;
 *     setConnectionCallbacks(conn, type);
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h4>Connection events</h4>
 * A generic function can be used to assign callbacks to connections.
 * <pre>
 * function setConnectionCallbacks(conn, type) {
 *     // Channel/Session callbacks
 *     conn.onusersinvited = function(users) {
 *         // ...
 *     };
 *     conn.onusersjoined = function(users, type, cookie) {
 *         // ...
 *     };
 *     conn.onuserdeclined = function(user) {
 *         // ...
 *     };
 *     conn.onuserleft = function(user) {
 *         // ...
 *     };
 *     conn.ondata = function(user, data) {
 *         // ...
 *     };
 *     
 *     // Session callbacks
 *     if(type == "session") {
 *         conn.onbroadcastdata = function(user, data) {
 *             // ...
 *         };
 *         conn.onusersremoved = function(user, users) {
 *             // ...
 *         };
 *         conn.onended = function(user) {
 *             // ...
 *         };
 *     }
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Adding Users to Connections</h3>
 * <p>There are two ways to add users to connections: (1) inviting contacts to join a connection, and
 * (2) hosting a connection for non-contacts to join. A user does not have to be the connection
 * creator in order to invite users.
 * 
 * <h4>1. Inviting contacts to join</h4>
 * <p>An application user can invite contacts to join a connection.</p>
 * <p>When the application calls {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Connection#inviteContacts} a Contact Picker dialog will be shown containing contacts that have the application installed.
 * If the user invites contacts then the {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Connection#event:onusersinvited} callback will be invoked on the inviter's side.</p>
 * <p>Invitees receive the invitations within BBM.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If they accept the invitation, {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Connection#event:onusersjoined} is invoked on the inviter's side, and {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.event:onconnectionaccepted} is invoked on the invitee's side with the connection they just joined. 
 * <li>If they decline the invitation, {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.Connection#event:onuserdeclined} is invoked on the inviter's side.
 * </ul>
 * <br>{@image /images/bbm/invite_to_join.png}<br>
 * 
 * <h4>2. Hosting a public connection for non-contacts to join</h4>
 * <p>An application user can also host an event within a public connection to let all application users join.</p>
 * <p>When the application calls {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.host} a dialog will be shown for the user to allow or deny the decision. If the user allows, the application should then post the host's PIN and PPID to its discovery service. <b>The BBM platform does not provide a discovery service. This must be provided by the application developer.</b>
 * <p>Peers should download host information (PIN and PPID) from the discovery service and then call {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.joinHost}. The peer will also be presented with a dialog to allow or deny the decision.
 * <p>At this point the request is in the <code>"pending"</code> state. In this state the peer can {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.OutgoingJoinRequest#cancel} the request, and the host can {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.IncomingJoinRequest#accept} or {@link blackberry.bbm.platform.io.IncomingJoinRequest#decline}.</p>
