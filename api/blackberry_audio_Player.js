* <div>
* Audio Player object for BlackBerry 5.0 smartphones that do not support the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element<br/><br/>
* Media locators are specified in URI syntax which is defined in the form: &apos;&lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;&apos;. 
* If scheme is &apos;local&apos;, media type should be specified.

* @toc {Media} Audio Player 
* @BB50+
* @RIPPLE
* @class The audio player is an API introduced so that audio can be played on the BlackBerry 5.0 operating system since the 
*		HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element is not yet supported on this OS. The audio player is intended to play audio files only 
*		which does <b>not</b> include streaming audio.
*		<br/><br/>
*		It is recommended that you use the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element on BlackBerry Operating Systems with versions higher than OS 5.0 as well as on the Tablet OS.
*		<br/><br/>
*       The audio Player object is an instance object; if a new instance is desired, it must be created using the new keyword.
* @featureID blackberry.audio.Player
* @constructor Construct a new Player object. 
* @param {String} locator Media locator string in URI syntax that describes the media content.
* @param {String} [type] The ContentType of the media.
* @param {Boolean} [async] The parameter specifying whether the player should asynchronously advance to PREFETCHED state. If not provided set to false.
* @example
* &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
*
*   function createPlayerFromMediaFileStoredInLocal() {
*     var playerInstance = new  blackberry.audio.Player(&quot;local:///res/filename.mid&quot;, &quot;audio/mid&quot;, true);
*   }
* 
*   function createPlayerFromMediaFileStoresInSystem() {
*     var playerInstance = new  blackberry.audio.Player(&quot;file:///store/home/user/music/filename.mid&quot;);
*   }
* &lt;/script&gt;
* @example
* &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
*   // Display some player static and non-static constants.
*   var playerInstance = new  blackberry.audio.Player(&quot;file:///store/home/user/music/filename.mid&quot;);
*   var res = blackberry.audio.Player.UNREALIZED;
*   alert(&quot;The value of UNREALIZED static constant is: &quot; + res);
*   res = playerInstance.EVENT_DURATION_UPDATED;
*   alert(&quot;The value of EVENT_DURATION_UPDATED non-static constant is: &quot; + res);
* &lt;/script&gt;
* @example
* &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
*   var playerInstance = new  blackberry.audio.Player(&quot;file:///store/home/user/music/filename.mp3&quot;);
* 
*   // Setting new time for media
*   playerInstance.mediaTime = 10000;
*   alert(&quot;New media time: &quot; + playerInstance.mediaTime);
* 
*   // Setting new volume for media
*   playerInstance.volumeLevel = 85;
*   alert(&quot;New volume level: &quot; + playerInstance.volumeLevel);
