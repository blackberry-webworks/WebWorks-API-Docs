    <shortdesc><i>Result error code for when too many devices have already performed a create channel for the provider application ID. (A create channel will effectively register a user with the PPG for public/BIS). Operations this error can occur on: createChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: No action can be taken by the application for this error, but it should somehow be communicated back to the content provider and then to RIM to try to increase the allowed subscription limit.</i></shortdesc>
