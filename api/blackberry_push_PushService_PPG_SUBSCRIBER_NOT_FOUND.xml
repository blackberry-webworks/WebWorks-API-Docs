    <shortdesc><i>Result error code for when a destroy channel operation fails because the subscriber could not be found on the PPG's end. Operations this error can occur on: destroyChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: This error can most likely be ignored since if the subscriber could not be found on the PPG's end, then destroying the channel will have no effect anyway (it is as if they were never registered with the PPG using create channel).</i></shortdesc>
