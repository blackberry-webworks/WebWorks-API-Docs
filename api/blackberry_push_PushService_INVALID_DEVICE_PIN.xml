    <shortdesc><i>Result error code for an invalid device PIN as determined by the PPG. Operations this error can occur on: createChannel, destroyChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: Retrying the operation might correct the issue. The PIN is obtained under the covers by the public/BIS PPG. It very rarely has issues obtaining the device PIN, so a retry might fix this.</i></shortdesc>
