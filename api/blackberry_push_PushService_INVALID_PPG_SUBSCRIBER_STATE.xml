    <shortdesc><i>This result error code should not typically be encountered. It would only occur if a create or destroy channel operation internally causes the state of a subscriber on the PPG to be in an invalid state. Operations this error can occur on: createChannel, destroyChannel (only if using public/BIS PPG). Recommended action: If this error occurs, it should be logged and reported to the RIM support team.</i></shortdesc>
