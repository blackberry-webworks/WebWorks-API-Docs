            <p>A recurrence rule and a start date yield a set of possible dates. For example, a daily event that repeats five times starting at July 23rd 2012 has five possible dates.</p>
            <p>With the default interval value of one, the occurrences for this event will be the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th and 27th. With a value of two, the occurrences will be 24th, 26th, 28th, 30th and 1st of August.</p>
